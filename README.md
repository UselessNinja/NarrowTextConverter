A simple Python script that allows to convert a ".txt" generated by FEBuilder's import Text function in the same folder as itself to its NarrowText equivalent.

## How to use:
Create a new folder.

Put the NarrowTextConverter.exe in it.

Put the FEBuilder generated ".txt" in the folder.

Launch NarrowTextConverter.exe

Import back the converted ".txt" file to your FE8 Rom.

## Notes:
I'll update it later with less hardcoded offsets.

I plan to let the user choose other then forcing every non-menu text.
